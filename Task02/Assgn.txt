4. How many types of version control systems are there ?
    The two main categories of version control system are:
        a. Centralized Version Control
            The main concept of a centralized system is that it works in a client and server relationship. 
            The repository is located in one place and provides access to many clients. Itâ€™s very similar 
            to FTP in where you have an FTP client which connects to an FTP server. All changes, users, 
            commits and information must be sent and received from this central repository.

        b. Decentralized Version Control
            In distributed version control, each user has their own copy of the entire repository, not just 
            the files but the history as well. Think of it as a network of individual repositories. In many 
            cases, even though the model is distributed, services like Beanstalk are used for simplifying the 
            technical challenges of sharing changes. The two most popular distributed version control systems 
            are Git and Mercurial.
