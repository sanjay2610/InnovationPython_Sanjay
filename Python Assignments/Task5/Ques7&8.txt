7. 	Write any example on decorators.
    # importing libraries 
    import time 
    import math 
    
    # decorator to calculate duration 
    # taken by any function. 
    def calculate_time(func): 
        
        # added arguments inside the inner1, 
        # if function takes any arguments, 
        # can be added like this. 
        def inner1(*args, **kwargs): 
    
            # storing time before function execution 
            begin = time.time() 
            
            func(*args, **kwargs) 
    
            # storing time after function execution 
            end = time.time() 
            print("Total time taken in : ", func.__name__, end - begin) 
    
        return inner1 
    
    
    
    # this can be added to any function present, 
    # in this case to calculate a factorial 
    @calculate_time
    def factorial(num): 
    
        # sleep 2 seconds because it takes very less time 
        # so that you can see the actual difference 
        time.sleep(2) 
        print(math.factorial(num)) 
    
    # calling the function. 
    factorial(10)
